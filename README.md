This repository contains code samples referenced in my Medium blog post, ["C# Access Modifiers"](https://medium.com/c-sharp-programming/c-access-modifiers-9a65a5cd9133). This post and repository focus on understanding and utilizing access modifiers in C#, which control the visibility of classes, methods, and other members.

## Overview
In this blog post, I discuss various access modifiers in C# that help define the scope and accessibility of types and their members. Each modifier is demonstrated with code examples to show how they can be effectively used to implement encapsulation and data hiding.

### Accessibility Levels Covered

- **Public**  
  Members are accessible from anywhere.

- **Private**  
  Members are accessible only within the containing class.

- **Protected**  
  Members are accessible within the containing class and by derived class instances.

- **Internal**  
  Members are accessible only within the same assembly (project).

- **Protected Internal**  
  Members are accessible from within the same assembly or from derived classes in another assembly.

- **Private Protected**  
  Members are accessible within the containing class and by derived class instances, but only if those derived classes are within the same assembly.

- **File (Internal)**  
  Members are accessible only within the file in which they are declared.
